You may have noticed that many of the core Perl sites, 
such as <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">www.cpan.org</a> and 
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">www.perl.org</a> look a lot different. 
Indeed, they look a lot better. Perl, being very popular in 
the early days of the web, it’s websites settled on the early 
features and never left them. Leo Lapworth dragged many of the 
Perl websites into the modern age and made them look more attractive at the same time. 
Not only that, he’s one of the driving forces behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170411032641/http://perlnews.org/" class="web-archive">Perl News</a>.
Surely there’s more to come from Leo, too. For this, we recognize 
<a href="http://leo.cuckoo.org/">Leo Lapworth</a> for 
the 2011 White Camel Award for Perl community.
