Jim Keenan has been a quiet but effective Perl influence.
For years he led Perl Seminar New York, a technical complement to <a href="https://www.pm.org/groups/0.html">NY.pm's</a> social focus.
He volunteers to help at many hackathons, gently advises new events,
and was instrumental in bringing together separate Perl groups within New York City.
