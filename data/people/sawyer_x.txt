You can hardly go to a Perl conference (or <a href="http://amsterdamx.pm.org">Amsterdam X Perl mongers</a>) without hearing Sawyer X talk about the wonders of the Perl community (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjOQZf0Ad74">The Joy in What We Do</a>). He writes the <a href="https://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/p5p-summary/">Perl 5 Porters weekly summaries</a> and has been a driving force in the Dancer community. No matter where he shows up, in person or online, he's been the shining light of kindness and helpfulness that makes the Perl community a nice place to move bits around.
