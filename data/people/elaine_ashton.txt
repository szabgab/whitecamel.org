Elaine Ashton has been active in Perl Mongers almost since its beginning. 
She has been involved in the <a href="https://www.pm.org/groups/0.html">New York</a>, <a
href="http://stlouis.pm.org">St. Louis</a>, and <a
href="http://boston.pm.org">Boston</a> Perl user groups which were some
of the first user groups to get started. She donated time and resources
which have been invaluable in helping to establish other new user
groups, and she has hosted large user group meetings and social events
at her home.
