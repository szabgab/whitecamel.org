Steffen MÃ¼ller, also known as tsee, has done quite a bit of technical work for the Perl community, but he's one of the people helping with the non-technical aspects in too many ways to mention. He's especially stood out in recent years with his work through Booking.com, writing for <a href="https://blog.booking.com/">their technical blog</a> and being a driving force behind <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/bookingcom_donate_60000_to_per_1">Booking.com's generous donations</a> to The <a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/perl-core-development-fund.html">Core Maintenance Fund</a>.
