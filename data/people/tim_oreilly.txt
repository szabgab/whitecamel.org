You may think of  <a href="http://tim.oreilly.com/">Tim</a> as the guy
who published
<i>Programming perl</i> and <i>Learning Perl</i>, but he also
kick-started the current form of the Perl community by giving it a
place to come to together once a year. O'Reilly &amp; Associates
started The Perl Conference in 1997. Perl Mongers, the organization
that helped start Perl users groups all over the world, started at
that first Perl Conference. O'Reilly Media has been incredibly
gracious and helpful to the Perl community.
