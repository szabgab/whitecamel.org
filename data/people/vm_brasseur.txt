VM Brasseur <a href="https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2014/07/15/san-francisco-perl-mongers-12-months-50-growth/">now runs the San Francisco Perl mongers</a> (now on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Perl/member/12262349/">Meetup</a>) and has been instrumental in keeping that group running smoothly and constantly growing. She also runs the <a href="https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Perl_Companies">Perl Companies</a> project to mine job adverts data to identify organizations using Perl. Coincidentally, Fred Moyer, the former organizer of the same group, received a White Camel Award last year.
