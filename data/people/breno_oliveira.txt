Breno G. de Oliveira, or just "garu", is a social connector in the Brasilian Perl
community as well as the <a href="http://sdl.perl.org/">Perl SDL community</a>.
Active in <a href="http://rio.pm.org/">Rio.pm</a>, he's was also the organizer of
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150218004509/http://yapcbrasil.org.br/2011/" class="web-archive">YAPC::Brasil 2011</a> 
in Rio de Janeiro.  He's contributed to the PerlSDL book.
With a little help, he wants to unite the global Perl community by visiting every YAPC he can
and helping other people to travel to Brasil to meet Perl programmers they might not otherwise interact with.
