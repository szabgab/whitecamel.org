If you're doing Perl in Brasil, you probably know "maluco", also known as Thiago Rondon. Not only does he run multiple business with heavy doses of Perl, but he was the leader of the <a href="https://sao-paulo.pm.org/">São Paulo Perl mongers</a> and the organizer of the Brasilian versions of the Perl Advent calendars, called <a href="https://sao-paulo.pm.org/pub">Equinócio</a>, which the local community runs twice a year. He's also the creator of <a href="https://github.com/thiagorondon/OpenData-BR">OpenData-BR</a>, which uses Perl to illuminate government spending data.
