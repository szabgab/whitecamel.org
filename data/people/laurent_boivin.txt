Laurent Boivin has been the treasurer of <a href="http://www.mongueurs.net">Les Mongueurs de Perl</a> since 2009. For a long time he was the force behind <a href="http://osdc.fr">OSDC.fr</a> (maybe returning in 2018) and instrumental in organizing several French Perl hackathons, including two QA Hackathons, a Toolchain Summit, and several <a href="http://patch.pm/p3/">patch.pm</a>. It's these sorts of behind-the-scenes non-technical work that keep all of these wonderful events going.
