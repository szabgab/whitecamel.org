For years, Karen Pauley has been on the shortlist of people nominated for a
White Camel Award for her work as the president of <a
href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a>. For
several years she has kept the gears turning, oversaw various major
improvements in management, and putting everything in good order. This
year <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/tpf_president_change">
she has stepped out of her role in TP</a>. Since she's no longer
part of TPF, we can recognize her with this award. <a

Mark Keating has a much longer discussion of her
work at TPF</a>.
