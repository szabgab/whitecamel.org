Ask provides many support services for the Perl community including
mailing lists for most lists devoted to Perl, hosting for Perl related
web sites such as <a href="http://dev.perl.org/">dev.perl.org</a> and 
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">www.perl.org</a>. Special thanks to
Ask's employer, ValueClick, for allowing him to help Perl.
