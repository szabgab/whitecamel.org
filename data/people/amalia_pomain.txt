Amalia Pomian takes care of everything when organizing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211202080119/https://cluj.pm/" class="web-archive">cluj.pm</a> events: booking the place to hold the meetings, creating the schwag, taking care that the guest speakers have a great itinerary here, arranging the talks, promoting the events, keeping in touch with all the participants, and most other things.
