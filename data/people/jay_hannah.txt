Jay Hannah keeps <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers user groups</a>
running. Perl Mongers started by providing free web hosting, domain
names, mailing lists, and other central services to make it as easy as
possible for new user groups to start and to attract Perl hackers in their
area. The maintenance of these services has always been a thankless job,
and the Perl community is fortunate that Jay Hannah keeps it working.
