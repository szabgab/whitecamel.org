Rob Masic is one of the co-founders of <a href="https://www.evozon.com">Evozon</a> through which much Perly goodness flows. Evozon hosted YAPC::EU 2016 in Cluj and sponsors many other Perl events around the world. They support the local Perl mongers group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211202080119/https://cluj.pm/" class="web-archive">Cluj.pm</a>. They donated time with their graphic designers for YAPC::EU 2014 in Sofia and for various Perl website redesigns. They created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210518211152/http://www.builtinperl.com/" class="web-archive">BuiltinPerl</a>. Without the generosity of the entire company many of these things couldn't have happened.
