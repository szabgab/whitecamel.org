You probably know <A href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/timbunce">Tim Bunce</a> more for his technical acheivements, such as DBI, but he's been instrumental in developing Perl's early community. Tim was one of the small core of people who have made Perl and CPAN what it is today. He was there at the start of the Perl Packrats, which turned into CPAN. He was involved with the Perl Module List before we had things such as CPAN Search that made it easy to find modules. He worked as a PAUSE administrator. Any one of those would warrant a White Camel, even if he does deserve several.
