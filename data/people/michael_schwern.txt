<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/schwern/">Schwern</a> has been the force behind the rabid testing culture that's pervaded Perl. Aside from taking over maintenance of the basic modules that provide the framework that makes it work (a technical achievement outside the purview of these awards), he's traveled the globe advocating it, teaching it, and making it better. He's always the center of activity at a QA Hack-a-thon, where he's involved in the consensuses that come out those conflabs. The foundations he set has made Perl and CPAN the most widely tested codebase in the history of the known universe.
