If you’re doing Perl in Japan, you’ve probably run into Daisuke Maki. 
He’s active in Shibuya.pm and many of the YAPC::Asia. He also started 
the <a href="https://japan.perlassociation.org/">Japan Perl Association</a>, 
the counterpart to <a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a>
and <a href="http://www.yapceurope.org/">YAPC::Europe Foundation</a>.
For this, we recognize Daisuke Maki for 
the 2011 White Camel Award for Outstanding Contribution to Perl user groups.
